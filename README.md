# SIR-MODEL-in-MATLAB
SIR Model Simulation Using Euler Method in MATLAB
This repository contains a MATLAB script that simulates the classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological model using the Euler method for numerical integration. The program models the spread of an infectious disease in a fixed population over time, computing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals.

Key features include:

Parameter initialization for infection rate (beta), recovery rate (gamma), initial populations, and total simulation time

Numerical solution of the system of differential equations using the Euler method

Graphical visualization of the SIR compartments over time

This script aims to provide a simple and educational implementation of the SIR model that can be customized for various disease dynamics and population settings.
